#+TITLE: Claraman

Claraman is a game project around two concepts. A rule engine named Clara and
event sourcing.

The running game can be found at https://bomberman.lambda-group.se/

* Event sourcing

  Events in the system tries to follow the [[https://cloudevents.io/][CloudEvent]] specification. Take a look
  at Johan Halebys [[https://occurrent.org/documentation#introduction][Occurent]] for nice documentation.

  In this bomberman game all events are saved into a list. Each time the list
  updates the changes are sent through a [[https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/reduce][reduce]] function together with the old
  game state. The reduce function updates the old state with the new events and
  returns a new game state.
